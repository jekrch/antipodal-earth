# JuxtaGlobe üåç

An interactive dual-globe visualization tool that lets you explore Earth from multiple perspectives simultaneously. Compare modern Earth with its antipodal points, explore prehistoric continental configurations, or set two independent points for comparison.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Dual Globe Display**: View two synchronized 3D globes side by side
- **Three Viewing Modes**:
  - **Antipodal Mode**: See the exact opposite point on Earth from any location
  - **Prehistoric Maps**: Explore Earth's continental configurations from different geological periods
  - **Dual-Point Mode**: Set and control two independent points on Earth
- **Location Detection**: Automatically centers on your approximate location via IP geolocation
- **Interactive Controls**: 
  - Drag to rotate globes
  - Scroll/pinch to zoom
  - Click buttons for quick navigation
  - Synchronized or independent control based on mode

### Advanced Features
- **Lock/Unlock Controls** (Dual-Point Mode): 
  - **Locked**: Both globes move together, maintaining their relative offset
  - **Unlocked**: Control each globe independently (altitude remains synchronized)
- **Map Tiles Toggle**: Enable/disable detailed map overlays on both globes
- **URL State Persistence**: 
  - All view states are saved in the URL
  - Share specific locations and views with others
  - Bookmark favorite locations
  - Supports both primary (lat, lng, alt) and secondary (lat2, lng2, alt2) coordinates
- **Responsive Design**: 
  - Optimized for desktop and mobile devices
  - Automatic layout adjustments for different screen sizes
  - Touch-friendly controls on mobile
- **Google Maps Integration**: Quick links to open any location in Google Maps
- **Attribution System**: Click map attributions to view detailed source information

## Prehistoric Maps Available

- Early Triassic (~240 Ma) - Pangea formation
- Early Jurassic (~200 Ma) - Pangea at its peak
- Middle Jurassic (~165 Ma) - Pangea beginning to break apart

## URL Parameters

JuxtaGlobe supports several URL parameters for sharing and bookmarking views:

- `lat`, `lng`, `alt` - Primary globe coordinates and altitude
- `lat2`, `lng2`, `alt2` - Secondary globe coordinates (dual-point mode only)
- `map=t` - Show map tiles when set to 't'

Example URLs:
- Antipodal view of NYC: `/antipodal?lat=40.7128&lng=-74.0060&alt=2.5`
- Dual points (NYC & Tokyo): `/dual-point?lat=40.9009&lng=-73.3583&lat2=35.8176&lng2=139.8101&alt=0.0181&alt2=0.0181&map=t`
- Prehistoric view with map tiles: `/early-jurassic?lat=41.2575&lng=-73.3982&alt=0.6000&map=t`
